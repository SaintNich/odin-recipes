        <ul>Ingredients (makes approximately 12 pancakes)
            <li>3 cups all-purpose flower</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
            <li>3 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>3 cups buttermilk</li>
            <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>1/3 cup butter, melted</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>Directions
            <li>In a large bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking               soda, and salt. In a separate bowl, beat together buttermilk, milk, eggs, and melted butter. Keep the two mixtures separate until you are ready to cook.</li>
            <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Pour the wet mixture into the dry mixture; use a wooden spook or fork to mix until it's blended together. The batter will be a little lumpy.</li>
            <li>Pour or scoop the batter onto the preheated griddle using approximately 1/2 cup for each pancake. Cook until bubbles appear on the surface, approximately 1 to 2 minutes; flip with a spatula and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
        </ol>
